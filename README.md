# portfolio- Was Deployed on heroku, working on redeploy
Source Code was provided, and features were added.
 
This was fun - should come back and cleanup.

They key to this project was to be able to judge how long features took to be implemented based on how we evaluated our own coding ability. some features i completed faster than i had fguess while others i had taken longer than i thought i would, great exercise.
